                <p class="challenge">This website was made for the sole purpose of learning the very basics of Javascript in an html environment. Basically, it's a tutorial website, which I will present to a professor in my school. The backstory is that he gave me an assignment or challenge to see if I could make a photo gallery using Javascript. Well, if you are seeing this website, I made the galley. So, enjoy it by clicking on the link below. </p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
